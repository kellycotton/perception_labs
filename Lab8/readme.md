1. Experiment setup
	- Adjust the stimulus tone presentation time (tone_time)
	- Adjust the time between tone presentations (tone_delay)
	- Adjust the fixation time (fix_time)
	- Adjust the number of trials (trial_n) 
	- Adjust the number of blocks (block_n)
	- If you change the number of conditions in the freq_conds files, change the total_accuracy multipliers

2. Practice instructions
	- Adjust the presented instruction text in instruct_text

3. Practice trials with feedback
	- Adjust the number of practice trials in trials_practice nReps. This will increase the number of trials to nReps x number of conditions.
