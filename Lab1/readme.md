## Absolute Identification

### Experimental 

1. Experiment setup
	- Adjust the fixation time (fix_time)
	- Adjust the intertrial delay (fix_delay)
	- Adjust the delay between fixation and stimulus presentation (stim_delay)
	- Adjust the number of trials per condition (trial_n) per block
	- Adjust the number of blocks (block_n)
	- If you change the number of conditions in the screen.csv file, change the total_accuracy multiplier 

2. Practice instructions
	- Adjust the presented instruction text in instruct_text

3. Practice trials with feedback
	- Adjust the possible stimuli pool in  number_generator by changing stim_number 
	- Adjust the number of practice trials in trials_practice nReps. This will increase the number of trials to nReps x number of conditions.

4. Experiment instructions
	- Adjust the presented instruction text in end_practice_text

5. Experimental trials
	- Number of trials per condition and number of blocks can be changed in the experiment setup.
