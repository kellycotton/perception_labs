	- Adjust the fixation time (fix_time)
	- Adjust the starting stimulus size (stim_size_start)
	- Adjust the stimulus presentation duration (stim_duration)
	- If you change the number of conditions in the coord_cond.csv file, change the total_accuracy multiplier 

2. Practice instructions
	- Adjust the presented instruction text in instruct_text

3. Practice trials with feedback
	- Adjust the number of practice trials in trials_practice nReps. This will increase the number of trials to nReps x number of conditions.
