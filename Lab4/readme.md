# PSY103L Lab 4
## JNDs Color Matching by Adjustment 

### Experimental Flow

1. Experiment setup
	- Adjust the circle (circle_size) and dot size (dot_size)
	- Adjust the fixation time (fix_time)
	- Adjust the number of blocks (block_total)
	- Adjust the number of trials (trial_n) 
	- If you change the number of conditions in the colors.csv file, change the error_rgb and error_hsv multiplier 

2. Practice instructions
	- Adjust the presented instruction text in instruct_text

3. Practice trials with feedback
	- Adjust the number of practice trials in trials_practice nReps. This will increase the number of trials to nReps x number of conditions.

4. Experiment instructions
	- Adjust the presented instruction text in end_practice_text

5. Experimental trials
	- Currently set up to do all blocks of one color space (rgb) and then all blocks of the second color space (hsv)
